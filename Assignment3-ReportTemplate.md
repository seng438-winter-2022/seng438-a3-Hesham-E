# 1 Introduction


This lab covered unit testing once again, but this time it was about White-Box testing. The objective of this lab is to introduce us to the concepts of determining the adequecy of white-box test suite based on its covergae. This type of testing can take many forms, including control-flow coverage criteria. Three coverage types were looked into: Statement, Branch, Condition. The unit testing was done with JUnit in Eclipse. Testing tools like EclEclemma is used followed by the implementation of the test suite. 

# 2 Manual data-flow coverage calculations for X and Y methods

# 3 A detailed description of the testing strategy for the new unit test

Text…

# 4 A high level description of five selected test cases you have designed using coverage information, and how they have increased code coverage

Text…

# 5 A detailed report of the coverage achieved of each class and method (a screen shot from the code cover results in green and red color would suffice)

Text…

# 6 Pros and Cons of coverage tools used and Metrics you report

Text…

# 7 A comparison on the advantages and disadvantages of requirements-based test generation and coverage-based test generation.

Text…

# 8 A discussion on how the team work/effort was divided and managed
